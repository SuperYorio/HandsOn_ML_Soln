# HandsOn_ML_Soln

This repo is mainly used for me to post my solutions to the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, & TensorFlow (2nd Edition) by Aurelien Geron.

I have decided to open-source my own solutions since half of the exercises in the book still does not have its solutions uploaded. I will try to upload more solutions as time goes on!

Contact me for any questions or issues. Thanks!

Happy Coding,
Super Yorio
